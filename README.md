### Hi, I'm Ethan 👋

Software Developer from South Wales, UK striving I specialize in Backend and low-level embedded development, but any activity requiring problem-solving and creativeness is where I'll be.

All of my non-web(C/c++ Rust and so on) related projects will be on https://sr.ht/~glassofethanol/

##### Where you'll find me

* 🤵 Because "you have to" <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-morgan-24377213a/">LinkedIn</a>
